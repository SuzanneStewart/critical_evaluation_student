Getting information about what is meant by terms like description, evidence, synthesis, critical evaluation, and argument Seeing examples of these key writing content elements in excerpts from students' work Practising identifying these elements in other examples from students' work Practising identifying these elements and how they work together in professionals' work If there's time: practising using these elements in your own writing 1.0.2 What are the aims of this session? To better understand what terms like &quot;critical evaluation,&quot; &quot;argument,&quot; and &quot;evidence&quot; mean To better understand how to develop insightful critical evaluations, arguments, etc. To gain experience in identifying critical evaluation, arguments, etc. in experts' work 1.0.3 What should I do? During the introductory video, take notes. During the students' examples exercise, discuss with a partner or think on your own about the examples and participate in the polls. During the journal article exercise, work with a partner or on your own to pick out examples of the key writing content elements. If there's time, during the writing exercise, use what you've learned to try out the key elements. We'll start off with a video introducing the key writing elements, what skills are needed for them, and observing how they're used in other students' work: "],
["example-1-excerpt.html", "2 Example 1 excerpt", " 2 Example 1 excerpt Now we'll look at six more excerpts from students' work. Discuss each example with a partner (or think through them on your own if you prefer) and decide what writing component(s) each excerpt best demonstrates, and then select your response(s) in the poll. Choose just one or two options for each excerpt. “Parental attitudes, such as the positive attitudes that contribute to self-worth (Trowell et al., 2007) and the negative attitudes that prompt depression (Rutter, 1988; Stark, 1990, cited in Sternberg, 1997), and parental behaviours, such as parental absence and family disruption after the loss of a relative (Alloy et al., 2006; Garber &amp; Flynn, 2001; Weller, Weller, Fristad, &amp; Bowes, 1991, cited in Stark et al., 2012), are all linked to childhood depression and could apply to Max.” DECIDE: Does this excerpt best represent description, evidence, synthesis, critical evaluation, or argument?

However, due to Max’s age, the more rapid outcomes associated with CBT may not occur, as CBT’s heavy reliance on dialogue and written feelings may be difficult or unenjoyable for young children (Dophiede, 2006).” DECIDE: Does this excerpt best represent description, evidence, synthesis, critical evaluation, or argument?

However parental involvement in CBT has not always been associated with significant improvement (Stallard, 2006), therefore a combination approach may be necessary. The combination of CBT and medication has been found to be more effective in the treatment of depression (O’Callaghan &amp; Cunningham, 2015), however NICE guidelines (2015) state medication should only be prescribed in severe cases of depression and does not advise subscription to children.” DECIDE: Does this excerpt best represent description, evidence, synthesis, critical evaluation, or argument?
